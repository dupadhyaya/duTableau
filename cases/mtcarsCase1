Case Study on MT Cars Dataset
The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).
A data frame with 32 observations on 11 (numeric) variables.

[, 1]	mpg	Miles/(US) gallon
[, 2]	cyl	Number of cylinders
[, 3]	disp	Displacement (cu.in.)
[, 4]	hp	Gross horsepower
[, 5]	drat	Rear axle ratio
[, 6]	wt	Weight (1000 lbs)
[, 7]	qsec	1/4 mile time
[, 8]	vs	Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)
[, 9]	am	Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
[,10]	gear	Number of forward gears
[,11]	carb	Number of carburetors

Three more columns have been added
      carnames
      state  State where the car is being manufactured
      dateStart   Date when the car was launched into the market
Task1
1.1 How many rows and columns does this data have
1.2 Which one of them are Categorical and Numerical values (eg. Gear is category, mgp - numeric)
1.3 Which one of the are Dimensions and Measures
1.4 What are the data types of each column : Integer, Decimal, String, Boolean, Date ?, Geo?
1.5 How to load the data in Tableau ? Which is better Live or Extract ?

Taks2 
2.1 : How Many Cars are there ?
2.2 : Show the Gear Category Count in Decreasing Order




Task3
3.1 : is a car with automatic or manual transmission better in term of miles per gallons (mpg)?
3.2 : quantify the mpg difference between automatic and manual transmission.
